## Unit 3: Reflection Blog

### Formal Report So Far

##### Research

Research for my formal report was actually painless using my contacts from my time in industry and in Computer Science at UBC. As I am at the end of my degree I have made many contacts, friends, and acquaintances and was able to get lots of responses, interest and buzz around my surveys to get quality results. On top of that, my colleagues  from past internships and work experience provided me with excellent insight during out interviews that I can't thank them enough for.

##### Organization

Organizing a report like that was relatively simply given the assignment before it was to lay out all the headings and the general structure of the report. Following the guidelines, I was able to know exactly where I wanted my data, findings, and visuals to all be placed.

##### Writing

As organization was straightforward, and my research went smoothly with my excellent contacts and decent response rate to my survey, writing was simply a matter of a putting the pieces of the puzzle in place. Following that and a bit of analyzing of the results I was able to write and construct my report with ease.

##### Peer Reviewing

Peer reviewing another report was an interesting experience. Looking past the content of the report, it was interesting to see how other people portrayed the problems, the research to solving them, and proposed solutions for them. Comparing with my own report it became apparent which things were effective in the different reports. An example is quality headings and sub-headings to truly divide the content or use of spacing between sections to establish barriers or adjust the flow of the document.

##### Conclusion

The report has shaped up quite well and following the feedback from my peer and the professor I think I'll have a truly quality and professional document completed for this class.
