### Learning Process This Term

Over the term I've learned a lot about my learning process through my assignments. 

I've always prided myself in my ability to learn quickly but writing and english have never been my stronger abilities. With that in mind I've learned that first drafts should never be trusted in writings. Spell check and grammar check with writing tools can only go so far when it comes to having your pieces actually make sense and only upon personal and peer review can you catch some mistakes you wonder how you didn't see in the first place. I've really come to appreciate peer reviews and definitely won't be afraid to ask for a second set of eyes on my writing moving forward. 

Aside from that, I think throughout the term I've been fairly effective at taking complex subjects and topics and breaking them into simpler, more digestible pieces for those who may not be well versed in that area of expertise. Starting from the definition assignment all the way through formal report I've been successfully at simplifying dense ideas into palatable ones where my writing group mates have had little issue understanding despite not having the same educational background as myself.

### In To The Future

Looking in to the future I'm confident that my writing skills we be helpful for many reasons. Technical documentation is a given in my career and some of the things we've practiced so far should prove invaluable such as focusing on purely the details and using clear and concise details. On top of that, my future will certainly entail interaction and writing with non-technical management, customers, and coworkers. Having practiced and dialed in my skills breaking things down and writing deeply technical documents for a non-technical reader, I feel confident that I will be successful when this will be required of me.
