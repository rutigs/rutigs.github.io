## Unit 2: Reflection Blog

### Professional Social Media

Prior to this assignment I had previously created a LinkedIn Profile to establish my online presence as I've previously looked for internships and co-ops for my future career. At first, I thought the concept was counterintuitive as my narrow view of social media was purely friendship but after reading and learning more about LinkedIn and what it has to offer I'm happy to have improved my profile following the assignment.

### Formal Report So Far

Aside from clearing up some questions I have in regard to audience I'm very happy with my progress towards my formal report. I feel as though I have all the groundwork in place and following my execution of the interviews, I will be in a very good place to finish my research and construct a quality report. The report is very near and dear to me as it is researching a problem that I have faced, poor interview process for Software Engineering roles, and I'm looking forward to establishing and solving the problems within it.

### Peer Review

Reviewing other's writing work is still very new to me, it's not like a code review that I have done in the past, and as such is very interesting trying to analyze writing without looking too closely at the content. I think it's really hammered in the thought that the writing can be both very specific in detail without alienating a reader with jargon and tribal knowledge to them.

As such, I have tried to incorporate some of these ideas following reading other's proposals and their feedback on my own. While in some cases technical terms are necessary but it's very important to know exactly _when_ they are necessary. 

#### End Result

The sheer amount of writing in this course has been quite eye opening. As a Computer Science major, I think I've written more in this class than all my classes previously combined, and its been very eye opening to see how much I have and can improve in this aspect. I'm very certain the writing aspect of my career will no doubt benefit from the practice and lessons so far and still to come.
