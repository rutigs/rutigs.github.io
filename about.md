<p>I'm a Software Engineer and Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia. I previously used to intern at Microsoft working on desktop applications and the backend services that power them. These days I'm both passionate and deeply interested in networking, distributed systems and most recently security.</p>

<p>I'm also very interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, especially with the fork in the Bitcoin community this year as well.</p>
