<p>I'm a Software Engineer living and working in Vancouver, BC. I graduated with a major in Computer from the University of British Columbia. I previously used to intern at Microsoft working on desktop applications and the backend services that power them. Currently you can find me at [Cumul8](https://cumul8.com/) as a Backend Engineer working on our data platform. These days I'm both passionate and deeply interested in networking, distributed systems and most recently security.</p>
